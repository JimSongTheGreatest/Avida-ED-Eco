# Help and Instructions for using environment.cfg files and the Test Setup Page. 
#
# The buttons on the test setup page work, but I do NOT recommend changing the 
# test dish size on a given example as all the input(x & y), output(x & y) and cellbox
# values would need to change. 
#
# A plain text version of this file is environment.cfg of the "Instructions" test dish. 
#
# ========================================================================================
# Formating
#
# The "#" sign is a comment for that line and avida will ignore the rest of the line.
# The pattern of white space and colons must be followed 
#   or avida cannot read the file. 
#
# the "\" is a line continuation character. 
# Do not add a hard return in a data line without the \ character at the end, 
# Do not add spaces unless there is already white space there. 
#
# extra blank lines are fine. 
#
# ========================================================================================
# About RESOURCES 
#
# more details are about Avida Environment files is at 
#    https://github.com/devosoft/avida/wiki/Environment-file
#
# There must be at least one REACTION for each of the 9 tasks that Avida-ED uses,
#    even if there is no reward.
# A logic-9 function can have more than one resource/reaction. 
#
# Feel free to edit the values for 
#   inflow:  this is the total amount of the resource, 
#            so the inflow per cell = inflow area of the inflow 
#            as defined by inflowx1, inflowx2, inflowy1, inflowy2
#   outflow: this the fraction (0.0 and 1.0) of the resource that flows out of each cell
#            in the area as defined by outflowx1, outflowx2, outflowy1, outflowy2
#            
#   xgravity or ygravity: range -1.0 to 1.0; how fast the resource flows in that direction. 
#                         The movement is only dependent on the amount in the given cell.
#                         There is only flow in one direction, up, down, left or right or
#                         a diagonal from the combination of x and y gravity.
#   xdiffuse or ydiffuse: range 0.0 to 1.0; how fast the resource diffuses where the flow
#                         depends on the amount in adjacent cells. 
#   for both gravity or diffusion when limited to horizontal flow, in avida, there is still
#      some flow to the diagonal cells. For instance, if the flow is down, most some flows
#      into the cells in each diagonal direction as they are still below the source cell. 
#
# Default values
#   inflow = outflow = 0.0
#   xgravity = ygravity = 0.0
#   xdiffuse = ydiffuse = 1
# 
# Most formating errors will cause avida to stop. The program will probably need to be reloaded. 
#
# In each example file, I tried to only vary two parameters
#
# If you change inflowX1, inFlowX2, inflowY1, inflowY2, outflowX1, outflowX2, outflowY1,
# outflowY2 or the cellbox values be sure the coordinates stay in the dish size.
#
# cellbox=0,20,20,20 where the first two numbers are the coordinates of the upper left
#         corner of the box. The last two numbers are the box size. Row and column numbers
#         in Avida start with 0. Cell box contains the resource in that boxed area. The 
#         cell box and the inputx and y, & outputx and y values much match. Without cellbox
#         the resources could cross subdish areas if diffusion and or gravity is active. 
#
# cellbox keeps the resources in their own subdish.
